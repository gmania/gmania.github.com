This article should be posted after I've developed a regular habit of blogging and have achieved a certain amount of categories rather than put on the very beginning. However I put it here in order to recall the course of my absorbing inspiring ideas in various blogs and more importantly to show my resolution to keep on blogging on a regular pattern.

### Google Reader
I've been using Google Reader since I was in Under-Graduate School almost 5 years ago when I was by chance attracted by a web page introducing it. I had signed up a Google account and benefited from Google Search, Gmail, Google Calendars, etc, so I opened Google Reader instantly and subscribed several recommended RSS seeds. It was amazing. The articles were well organized and listed neatly by time. After using it for a period of time I utterly could not go without it. 

During that time I read variety of blogs, news, opinions written in Chinese and English covering TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design), Education, LifeStyle, Health, Economic, so on and so on. I had read more articles than any time before. 

### Knowledge Management
It's not your knowledge after reading so much unless you learn it or can reach it anywhere anytime. So knowledge management tools were what I used next. I tried Delicious, Read It Later(now Pocket), EverNote, Dropbox, XMarks, Wiz, OneNote, etc, and the first three are still in use.

### Twitter
Above tools are to receive things and then comes Twitter, a micro-blog for everyone to give things. 

When you read good enough, you have a desire to write, to express opinions of your own. Traditional Blog seems far away for ordinary individuals because first of all you need a server, a website, and then you'd better have the knowledge of HTML&CSS programming, finally you must have good writing skills and well conceived opinions to publish. 

While in Twitter, a ready platform is present to you and what's need to be done is enter 140 words into a textbox. You can publish whatever you're doing and whatever you think at the present within only 140 words. There's no pressure of quality or quantity. You posts can be read or even ignored by others if they choose to do. You can now feel like a real writer. 

### GitHub
Here comes again a insufficiency. 140 words are far from enough to describe a thing adequately. People tend to post simplified versions with less decorating and toneless expressions, and  people tend to post immediately having an idea before it becomes mature. Moreover, in Twitter, you don't only posts but also read so you have to read a lot of trivial and trimmed sentences by others which may result in impatience of intensive reading and disability of deep thinking. 

Thus I put aside Twitter for a while and focused on articles and essays of good quality and spent more time thinking until recently I got knowing of blogging in GitHub at the help of Jekyll.

GitHub is a web-based hosting services for software development projects that use the Git revision control system. In plain words, Git is a revision control system in which programmers can commit and check in their updates. And GitHub is a repository of your commits and you can have a better view of them and also can view and share others'. I'm not a programmer though I knew GitHub for years and had an account to deposit and maintain my Vim configuration files and AutoHotKey source code.

To blog on GitHub is a brilliant idea because you can consider your blog posts as source code and compose them in the way programmers coding at their local machine, by which you can focus solely on the contents even when there's no Internet access, and commit them later on when you finish with your articles. 

### Jekyll
There still is a little drawback for non-web-developers in using GitHub to blog because it requires at least basic HTML knowledge and even CSS if you want to make your pages more attractive. Jekyll, as a simple, blog aware, static site generator, is born to eliminate such barriers by enabling Markdown conversion into HTML and providing a template directory with beautiful themes.

Then by simply writing your posts and putting them into `\_posts` folder, you get a professional blog in a instant.

Regarding usage of GitHub+Jekyll, I'll introduce more in another post.
