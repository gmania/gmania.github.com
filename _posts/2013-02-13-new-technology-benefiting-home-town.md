Mother has got an Android smart phone K-Touch T619 by pre-charging phone call cost. Knowing nothing about smart phone philosophy, Mother treats it as a ordinary cell phone, complaining about its complexity and uneasy to use. 

There are a bunch of useless applications (APPs) pre-installed by SP crowding around the home screen and background. It can be very distracting for a non-skilled person to find a target APP. To make it worse, these APPs are using up system resources and can not be uninstalled unless acquiring *root* authority which is unimaginable for ordinary people let alone my mother.

Fortunately I'm home having my spring festival and I'm ready in knowledge of the always growing technology. I refreshed the Android system with a slim one and acquired root authority. Although it's not a mainstream Android phone I was able to find a simplified but optimized ROM shared by net friends. 

It felt much more light and easy looking at the new system, and the default configurations are pleasing too. I installed several popular and frequently used APPs like QQ, WeChat, Music Player (supporting online search), WallPaper, Weather, and Talking Tom Bear. It didn't take long until Mother learned to use these APPs.

Mother was happy and so was I. It's satisfying to see new technology permeating and benefiting our beloved back in home town.
